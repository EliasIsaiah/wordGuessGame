# wordGuessGame

This is a word guessing game with the theme of the Great Outdoors. The way that it works is pretty simple (although it is not fully working yet).

## index.html:

This is a simple webpage that contains a few different elements for displaying feedback from the game. it contains the following elements:

* ### Title Div

    The title div contains the title of the game (Outdoors Word Guessing Game).

* ### Instructions Div

    The instructions div contains the instructions for starting the game (the game in its current incarnation starts on its own, but the finished product will on keypress.)

* ### Content Div

    The content div contains the main content for the game. This will consist of the blank underscores indicating how many letters the random word consists of, and the remaining blank letters as the player makese guesses and slowly fills in the word

* ### Feedback Div

    The feedback div contains feedback from the game. Currently there is nothing being written to the feedback div, but the finished product will indicate to the player which letters they have already tried by showing a growing list of guessed letters.

    Additionally there may be feedback as to whether or not the letter that the player that the player guessed is contained in the random word (for added clarity to the player).
